## LibDriver ISD17XX

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/isd17xx/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The Nuvoton ISD1700 ChipCorder Series is a high quality, fully integrated, single-chip multi-message voice record and playback device ideally suited to a variety of electronic systems. The message duration is user selectable in ranges from 26 seconds to 120 seconds, depending on the specific device. The sampling frequency of each device can also be adjusted from 4 kHz to 12 kHz with an external resistor, giving the user greater flexibility in duration versus recording quality for each application. Operating voltage spans a range from 2.4 V to 5.5 V to ensure that the ISD1700 devices are optimized for a wide range of battery or line-powered applications.

LibDriver ISD17XX is a full-featured driver for ISD17XX, launched by LibDriver. It provides recording, playback and additional features. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver ISD17XX source files.

/interface includes LibDriver ISD17XX SPI platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver ISD17XX driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver ISD17XX sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver ISD17XX offline document.

/datasheet includes ISD17XX datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface SPI platform independent template and finish your platform SPI driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_isd17xx_basic.h"

uint8_t res;

/* basic init */
res = isd17xx_basic_init(chip_type);
if (res != 0)
{
    isd17xx_interface_debug_print("isd17xx: basic init failed.\n");

    return 1;
}

/* erase */
res = isd17xx_basic_erase(start, end);
if (res != 0)
{
    isd17xx_interface_debug_print("isd17xx: basic erase failed.\n");
    (void)isd17xx_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* wait erase finished */
res = isd17xx_basic_poll(ISD17XX_STATUS2_ERASE);
if (res != 0)
{
    isd17xx_interface_debug_print("isd17xx: basic poll failed.\n");
    (void)isd17xx_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* output */
isd17xx_interface_debug_print("isd17xx: recording...\n");

/* record */
res = isd17xx_basic_record(start, end);
if (res != 0)
{
    isd17xx_interface_debug_print("isd17xx: basic record failed.\n");
    (void)isd17xx_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* wait rec finished */
res = isd17xx_basic_poll(ISD17XX_STATUS2_REC);
if (res != 0)
{
    isd17xx_interface_debug_print("isd17xx: basic poll failed.\n");
    (void)isd17xx_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* output */
isd17xx_interface_debug_print("isd17xx: playing...\n");

/* play */
res = isd17xx_basic_play(start, end);
if (res != 0)
{
    isd17xx_interface_debug_print("isd17xx: basic play failed.\n");
    (void)isd17xx_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* wait play finished */
res = isd17xx_basic_poll(ISD17XX_STATUS2_PLAY);
if (res != 0)
{
    isd17xx_interface_debug_print("isd17xx: basic poll failed.\n");
    (void)isd17xx_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* output */
isd17xx_interface_debug_print("isd17xx: finish.\n");

/* deinit */
(void)isd17xx_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
